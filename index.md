## Research interests

Edge computing and distributed machine learning systems

## Education

I am lucky enough to have spent my last 7 years with the School of Software Engineering, South China University of Technology ([SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/)), where I received B.Eng. in 2022. If everything goes fine, I will graduate and receive Master of Electronic Information in June 2025, after a three-year period of study and research supervised by Prof. YANG Lei.

## Publications

As of May 2025, my only publication is a conference paper that gathered the essentials of my current research:

__Yuesheng Tan, Lei Yang, Wenhao Li, and Yuda Wu. 2024. RoleML: a Role-Oriented Programming Model for Customizable Distributed Machine Learning on Edges. In Proceedings of the 25th International Middleware Conference (Middleware '24). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 279â€“291. https://doi.org/10.1145/3652892.3700765__
