## Research interests

Edge computing and distributed machine learning systems

## Education

I started my university life in 2018, when I was admitted to the __School of Software Engineering, South China University of Technology ([SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/))__ with an entrance exam score just enough for the class of brilliance. At the end of a four-year program, I received __B.Eng. in June 2022__ and was admitted to the graduate school without additional exam. After another three-year period of study and research supervised by Prof. YANG Lei, I received __M.Eng. (Electronic Information) in June 2025__, marking the official end of this unforgettable journey in the Higher Education Mega Center in Guangzhou.

## Publications

As of June 2025, my only publication is a conference paper that gathered the essentials of my current research:

__Yuesheng Tan, Lei Yang, Wenhao Li, and Yuda Wu. 2024. RoleML: a Role-Oriented Programming Model for Customizable Distributed Machine Learning on Edges. In Proceedings of the 25th International Middleware Conference (Middleware '24). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 279–291. https://doi.org/10.1145/3652892.3700765__
